%For vs While loops

%{
To be honest, I have no clue why MATLAB even uses both of them. 
You can accomplish the same thing with both. 
Regardless, here are the differences.
%}

%For loop
%{
The for loop requires you know how many loops to go through.
Syntax:
%}

a = [];
for x = 1:5
  a(x) = 1 + x;
end

%{
Something like that.
The code will run through each x value from 1 to 5.
You can also replace the integers with variables, like the length of a matrix.
%}

for x = 1:length(myData)
  a(x) = 1 + x;
end

%While loop
%{
The while loop will run forever unless you specify it to stop.
Syntax:
%}

x = 1;
while x < 6
  a(x) = 1 + x;
  x = x + 1;
end

%{
In the for loop, the x is just within that loop. 
It doesn't affect the rest of the code outside the loop.
In the while loop, the x is a variable in your code. 
If you try to use x later, the x you used in the while loop will have the value that the while loops ends with.
Also, please keep in mind that you will have an infinite loop on your hands if you aren't careful with while loops.
Always have the MATLAB equivalent of Python's += unless you have a break somewhere. Like this:
%}

while x < 6
  a(x) = 1 + x;
  break
end

%{
Though in this case, the break will cause the loop to not go through all the iterations you want it to.
So, the main differences between for and while loops:
1. For loops require you to know the number of iterations; while loops run until you tell it to stop.
2. For loops do not save the counting variable (x in this case); while loops do.
